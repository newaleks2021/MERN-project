                    We hate legalese, so we've tried to make ours readable. 
                    If you've got any questions, feel free to <a href='/contact/'>ask us</a>, and we'll do our best to answer.

                h3 The gist
                p.
                    We (the folks at Business for Development) run a web application called Changeroo 
                    and would <strong>love</strong> for you to use it. The application enables organizations to 
                    visualize and communicate about their societal value creation, and to engage stakeholders in the process. 
                    It generates a constantly evolving co-creation with stakeholders of a Wiki Report on the societal value creation of a business, 
                    NGO or project.
                    </br></br>
                    Our service differentiates between a user (a person), an organization and a Theory of Change (all refered to as "accounts"). 
                    A user has his or her personal account. This account enables a person to view and contribute to public Theories of Change. 
                    We refer to organizations as businesses, NGOs or projects that use our service to present their own Theory of Change and to communicate about their societal value creation. 
                    An organization account entitles an organization to develop one or more Theories of Change. A user can be linked to an organization account, which enables that user to manage subscription payments by that organization and to add new Theories of Change to the organization's account. 
                    Users are engaged in the process to contribute to these "presentations". To this end, users can be given a role within a particular Theory of Change.
                    </br></br>
                    Our service is free for user accounts.
                    Organizations can try Changeroo for free for 30 days. To continue using our services after 30 days, a paid subscription is needed.
                    </br></br>
                    Our service is designed to give organizations as much control and ownership over the information you present as possible. However, be responsible in what you publish.
                    </br></br>
                    If you find a Changeroo account that you believe violates our terms of service, please <a href='/contact'>contact us.</a>
