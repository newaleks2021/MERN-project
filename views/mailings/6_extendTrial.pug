//- Mailing 6: Extend free trial by 7 days
//- Template: SENDGRID_INFORMATIONAL_TEMPLATE_WITH_BUTTON_ID (1 button, 2 bodies)
//- CRON: On the day an organisation's free trial expires and organisation is activated. Sent to all admins of organisation (users need to be 'activated').
//- Add a flag to db. Also to ensure an organisation can only extend its free trial only once.
//- If the plan expires and the flag has already been set: still send the email but now without the offer to extend again.
