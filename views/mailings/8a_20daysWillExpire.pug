//- Mailing 8A: Subscription expires in 20 days
//- Template: SENDGRID_INFORMATIONAL_TEMPLATE_WITH_BUTTON_ID (1 button, 2 bodies)
//- CRON: Organisation has a subscription plan other than a free account that expires in 20 days. Organisation does NOT have autorenewal activated. Sends email to all organisation admins (users have to be 'activated').
//- Is een db flag nodig? Lijkt mij niet, of je moet die flag weer resetten wanneer de expiration date van de organisatie wijzigt (zoals bij renewen, upgraden, of als system admin dat direct in organisatie profiel wijzigt).
